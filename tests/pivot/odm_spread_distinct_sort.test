# This is a test of several complex behaviors.

# we pivot all the columns but hide the two fields that are not to be part of the distinct check (they vary on every row)

# when references to pivoted columns are made, and those references are contributing to a column that is output, 
# we don't create an output column for those pivoted columns

# the choice of min[] effectively hides RECORD_SEQ_ID and RUN_ID from the distinctness

# because sort[] is not contributing to an output column of its own, its reference to DOMAIN does NOT cause
# the pivoted column DOMAIN to be hidden

--in=odm.xml
Study..OID DOMAIN,...,RECORD_SEQ_ID,RUN_ID:pivot[ItemData..ItemOid,ItemData..value] 

# cause empty DOMAIN values to be last by picking a high ASCII value for those
sort[if[DOMAIN,DOMAIN,"~"]]

--distinct 
non_distinct:min[0,RECORD_SEQ_ID+RUN_ID]
